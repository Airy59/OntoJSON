The test ontology was created using the visual language [GRAPHOL](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/degiacom/papers/2022/fi2022lssd.pdf) that implements all of OWL2.

Many, but not all features available in OWL2-RL were used.

The graphic editor is [EDDY 3.7](https://github.com/obdasystems/eddy/releases)

Highly recommended!
